Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm is to solve under-determined problem, that is, to recover sparse signals from few samples. I will take sparse channel estimation as an example to describe how to implement AMP algorithm and compare it with the well-known OMP (orthogonal matching pursuit) algorithm.

## Under-determined Problem (Example: Sparse Channel Estimation)
Let us denote the channel information vector as \\(h\\), and sparse channel means that most of elements in \\(h\\) are zero. Consider transmitting pilot signals \\(x\\) through a sparse channel, and the received samples \\(y\\) vector is the convolution betwwen signals \\(x\\) and the channel information vector \\(h\\). The equation of \\(y\\) is expressed as following:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
y_{1}\\
y_{2}\\
y_{3}\\
\vdots\\
y_{n}
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{N} & x_{N-1} & x_{N-2} & \ldots & x_1 \\
x_{1} & x_{N} & x_{N-1} & \ldots & x_2\\
x_{2} & x_{1} & x_{N} & \ldots & x_3 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
x_{N-1} & x_{n-2} & x_{n-3} & \ldots & x_{n}
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
h_{1}\\
h_{2}\\
h_{3} \\
\vdots\\
h_{N}
\end{bmatrix}
+ \boldsymbol{w}
$$

that is,
$$y=\boldsymbol{A}\cdot h +w$$
where \\(w\\) is assumed to be Gaussian noise vector and \\(\boldsymbol{A} (n\times N)\\) is called sening matrix, composed of shift pilot sigals. Note that the size of \\(y\\) is \\(n \times 1\\), and the size of \\(x\\) and \\( h\\) are \\(N \times 1\\).

To find the accurate solution of channel information vector \\(h\\), we may think that it is requirable that we have condition \\(n \geq N\\) based on our knowledge of linear algebra. However, in this scenario, our focus is to have good estimation of the channel while we can still have high data rate, which means that we would like to estimate the channel with received samples \\( y\\) as fewer as possible. Therefore, we try to find a good estimation of vector \\( h\\) with condition that \\( n \leq N), and this is an under-determined problem.
