title: Approximate Message Passing for Sparse Channel Estimation
description: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm is to solve under-determined problem, that is, to recover sparse signals from few samples. I will take sparse channel estimation as an example to describe how to implement AMP algorithm and compare it with the well-known OMP (orthogonal matching pursuit) algorithm.

Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm is to solve under-determined problem, that is, to recover sparse signals from few samples. I will take sparse channel estimation as an example to describe how to implement AMP algorithm and compare it with the well-known OMP (orthogonal matching pursuit) algorithm.

## Under-determined Problem (Example: Sparse Channel Estimation)
Let us denote the channel information vector as h, and sparse channel means that most of elements in h are zero. Consider transmitting signals \\(\mathbf{x}\\) through a sparse channel, and the received samples \\(y\\) vector is the convolution betwwen signals \\(x\\) and the channel information vector \\(h\\). The equation of y is expressed as following:


$$
M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \ldots \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \ldots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ldots \\
\end{array} \right)
$$
