title: Approximate Message Passing for Sparse Channel Estimation
description: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm is to solve under-determined problem, that is, to recover sparse signals from few samples. I will take sparse channel estimation as an example to describe how to implement AMP algorithm and compare it with the well-known OMP (orthogonal matching pursuit) algorithm.
