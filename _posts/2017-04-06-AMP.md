title: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) for Sp-arse Channel Estimation
description: AMP algorithm is to solve under-determined problem, that is, to recover sparse signal from few samples. We will take sparse channel estimation as an example to describe how to implement AMP algorithm and compare it with the well-known OMP (orthogonal matching pursuit) algorithm.
