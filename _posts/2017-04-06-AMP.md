title: Approximate Message Passing for Sparse Channel Estimation
description: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm is to solve under-determined problem, that is, to recover sparse signals from few samples. I will take sparse channel estimation as an example to describe how to implement AMP algorithm and compare it with the well-known OMP (orthogonal matching pursuit) algorithm.

Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm is to solve under-determined problem, that is, to recover sparse signals from few samples. I will take sparse channel estimation as an example to describe how to implement AMP algorithm and compare it with the well-known OMP (orthogonal matching pursuit) algorithm.

## Under-determined Problem (Example: Sparse Channel Estimation)
Let us denote the channel information vector as \\(h\\), and sparse channel means that most of elements in \\(h\\) are zero. Consider transmitting signals \\(x\\) through a sparse channel, and the received samples \\(y\\) vector is the convolution betwwen signals \\(x\\) and the channel information vector \\(h\\). The equation of y is expressed as following:


$$
\begin{bmatrix}
y_{1}\\
y_{2}\\
y_{3}\\
\vdots\\
y_{n}
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{N} & x_{N-1} & x_{N-2} & \ldots & x_1 \\
x_{1} & x_{N} & x_{N-1} & \ldots & x_2\\
x_{2} & x_{1} & x_{N} & \ldots & x_3 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
x_{N-1} & x_{n-2} & x_{n-3} & \ldots & x_{n}
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
h_{1}\\
h_{2}\\
h_{3} \\
\vdots\\
h_{N}
\end{bmatrix}
+ \boldsymbol{w}
$$
